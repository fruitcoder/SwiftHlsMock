# SwiftHlsMock
A little mock server to simulate hls locally based on Swifter.

##### Why?

You can use this package to have better control over your UITests by just starting the server and giving your player the localhost url. The server always streams the same segment (the 10 segments are identical) from [bensound](https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music/track/ukulele).

##### Try it

To try it out I'd recommend checking out the project and starting the Sample executable.
